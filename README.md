# Noto Sans Alt IJ
This is a slight modification of Noto Sans that uses stylistic alternates for capital I and J by default. Like the original Noto Sans, it consists of 9 weights (Thin, Extra Light, Light, Regular, Medium, Semi Bold, Bold, Extra Bold, Black) and 4 widths (Normal, Semi Condensed, Condensed, Extra Condensed), each with an italic variant, and covers Latin, Cyrillic and Greek scripts. [OTFeature Freezer](https://github.com/twardoch/fonttools-opentype-feature-freezer) was used to make this possible.
